Messaging App


Instructions:
This App can be run on an emulator or mobile device with a target API level of 25. A username must be supplied by the user at which point 
they will be asked to enter a groupname. You usually must wait a second or two before entering a groupname as the network connection is 
being initiated here. Entering a groupname will have the user join that group or create it on the GroupCast server if 
it does not exist. Once in a group, messages can be sent to and received from any other user in that group. Green messages indicate they 
are owned by the user and are on the right side of the screen. Orange messages were sent from different users. The server is currently 
deployed on an AWS EC2 instance. The public IP address is 35.164.171.94 which is already supplied to the client.

Android Client
The Android client communicates to the modified GroupCast server via a TCP connection. All of the networking is done in a Service, which 
must be able to communicate with various components. A Login Activity is the first that the user experiences. It takes a username as input 
and then starts the Main Activity with the username added as an extra. The Main Activity displays the groups that the user is a part of and
also allows for new groups to be joined / created. Once the user is in a group, clicking on it in the list will launch a new Message - 
Activity. Each conversation gets its own activity. These activities are able to communicate with the networking service by subscribing to 
it and also by registering to receive broadcasts. The main activity starts the networking activity and each spawned message activity binds
to it. Once the service is bound to an activity, the activity can receive and instance of it via a binder and call its public methods. This
is used to send messages to the server. When messages are received, the service sends out a broadcast with an action corresponding to the
name of the group. This ensures that only the intended group will receive the message. Messages are displayed in the message activity 
according to who sent them. Messages that the user sends are shown in green and placed on the right side of the screen while messages from
other users are placed on the left and shown in orange. Below each message is a timestamp as well as the name of the sender. A Message 
class was created to capture all of this information and facilitate displaying it. A custom adapter was used to place the messages
correctly in the ListView.
