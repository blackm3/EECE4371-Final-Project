EECE 4371 Final Project

The main components of the Android client are a main activity displaying conversations, an activity for the user to send messages, and a 
background service for networking purposes. A custom adapter will be used to help display messages in a familiar format. 

The GroupCast server will be used as the backend. In addition, a MySQL AWS instance has been set up for the database storage. The GroupCast
server will be modified to allow for interfacing with the database, which will be used to store conversations.
